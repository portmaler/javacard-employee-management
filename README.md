## Admin UI (admin_gui)

The `admin_gui` folder houses a JavaFX application designed to simplify employee and job management tasks. It features screens for adding employees, defining job roles, and establishing job assignments in the database. This component streamlines your administrative duties for efficient employee management.

## Confirmation Database (ConfirmationDb)

The `ConfirmationDb` folder hosts another JavaFX application with two pivotal screens. The initial screen prompts the user to enter a PIN code, subsequently connecting to a real Java Card reader. The second screen facilitates the confirmation of job assignments in the database. This component ensures secure and accurate job confirmation processes.

## Java Card Applet (employee)

The `employee` folder comprises the heart of the project—an essential Java Card applet. This applet enables secure access to employee information, including unique employee IDs, first names, and last names. It is a cornerstone for managing and retrieving vital employee data.

## Getting Started

To begin utilizing this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- A Java Card simulator or a physical Java Card
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your development machine
- JavaFX SDK (if not included in your JDK distribution)
